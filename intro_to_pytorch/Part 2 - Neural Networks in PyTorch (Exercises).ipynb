Each unit in one layer is connected to each unit in the next layer. In fully-connected networks, the input to each layer must be a one-dimensional vector (which can be stacked into a 2D tensor as a batch of multiple examples). However, our images are 28x28 2D tensors, so we need to convert them into 1D vectors. Thinking about sizes, we need to convert the batch of images with shape `(64, 1, 28, 28)` to a have a shape of `(64, 784)`, 784 is 28 times 28.

If you have a tensor `a` with shape `(64, 10)` and a tensor `b` with shape `(64,)`, doing `a/b` will give you an error because PyTorch will try to do the division across the columns (called broadcasting) but you'll get a size mismatch. The way to think about this is for each of the 64 examples, you only want to divide by one value, the sum in the denominator. So you need `b` to have a shape of `(64, 1)`. This way PyTorch will divide the 10 values in each row of `a` by the one value in each row of `b`. Pay attention to how you take the sum as well.
